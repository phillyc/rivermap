# Rivermap

A basic demo of how to plot points on a Mapbox map.

## Libs, tools, etc

This project uses the following tools:

* [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/overview/) -> Javascript library for display and manipulation of the map.
* [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/#examples) -> CSS Framework for responsive layout.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) -> Exactly what it says, free and awesome fonts.
